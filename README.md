# 🔐 Java OTP Generator

A simple Java program to generate secure, random OTPs (One-Time Passwords) using a combination of characters, numbers, and symbols.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Java's `Random` class to create secure OTPs or passwords. It includes logic to pick random characters from a mixed pool of:

- Uppercase letters (A–Z)
- Lowercase letters (a–z)
- Numbers (0–9)
- Symbols (!@#$%^&*_=+-/.?<>)  

---

## ✅ Features

- Generate OTPs or passwords of custom length
- Includes all essential character types
- Fast, secure, and easy to integrate into larger systems
- Console-based, beginner-friendly implementation

---

## 📁 File

### `OTPGenerator.java`

- Contains the main class and method
- Defines the character pool and password generation logic
- Uses `Random` to generate unpredictable output

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Define the desired OTP/password length
2. Use character sets for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
3. Randomly pick characters from the full pool
4. Print the generated OTP

## 📚 Concepts Used

- Java Strings and character manipulation
- `Random` class for generating randomness
- Array and loop operations
- String concatenation

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
